# Introduction / Abstract

This repository introduces a database system designed to protect sensitive information effectively. By segmenting data into smaller tables based on sensitivity levels (segregation), the system ensures security while maintaining data integrity. Encryption adds an extra layer of protection for sensitive data. The system's dynamic workflow establishes logical relationships between tables, ensuring real-time data integrity.

## Segregating Information based on its Sensitivity Level

To mitigate unauthorized access, sensitive data is divided into separate tables. The entity relationship diagram illustrates this segregation, emphasizing the separation of highly sensitive attributes such as `Patient_Health_Insu_No` and `Patient_Social_Insu_No` into distinct tablesâ€”`Patient_Health_INS_Table` and `Patient_Social_INS_Table`.

## Dynamic Referential Integrity

Instead of directly establishing referential integrity within tables, the system uses predefined PL/SQL procedures to create relationships at runtime. These procedures dynamically establish logical connections between tables based on parameters such as table names and column names, enhancing security and preventing reverse engineering attacks.

## Reducing Unauthorized Access via Encryption

Combining data segregation with encryption techniques significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Triggers encrypt sensitive information during insertion into their respective tables, ensuring minimal exposure even if unauthorized parties gain partial access.

## Audit Logging

Triggers are implemented to log operations on sensitive tables like `Patient_Social_INS_Table` and `Patient_Health_INS_Table` for traceability and accountability. The `Operation_Log` table captures operation types, affected tables, and corresponding row IDs for comprehensive auditing.

## Performance Evaluation

The performance evaluation demonstrates varying execution times for inserting and retrieving records under different configurations. Inserting 10,000 records ranges from 32 to 37 seconds, with the highest time observed when encryption and log triggers are both active. Retrieving 10,000 records without decryption shows minimal time impact, while decryption introduces a slight delay, with the highest recorded time being 15 seconds. These findings highlight the trade-offs between security measures and performance in the database system.
